  <p>My interest in Technology started recently when the pandemic of Covid-19 started. I was staying at home most of the time and it gave me an opportunity to reflect on what I want to do in my college career. I knew that I wanted to do something in the business field. Making money and running a business are always fascinating to me. Over the summer when I was staying at home, I had my first experience with coding and computer science through ICS 101 course. I’ve never thought about going into the STEM field but I realized that I want to study in college. MIS was a perfect match for me to be in STEM in the business field.</p>

<p>At Business night, a networking event held by Shidler College of Business, I had an opportunity to meet my mentor who works in the cyber security field. He gave me an insight into what it’s like to be working as a Cyber security operator and also how the skills you learn from MIS can be applied to many different fields. I knew there is so much more to learn about Information Technology and I’m excited to learn as much as I can through this course.</p>

<p>I entered the University of Hawaii as an Explanatory Business major and thought I was going to major in Entrepreneurship or marketing, however, my experience of taking ICS 101, and meeting a mentor shaped my interest in Management of Information Systems. I am always challenged by class materials, nonetheless, I am excited to learn new skills that are useful in the future.</p>

<p>This is why I chose to pursue a major in Management of Information Systems at the Shidler College of Business and I am excited to see what is ahead of me and where my career will take me in the future.</p>
