For my first attempt, I struggled to start off because I had no idea what to start with. Watching the screencast for the first time gave me some ideas however, it was still confusing and the result was DFN with more than 10 minutes over.  Then, I watched Youtube videos about Emmet to  learn about Emmet abbreviations. Not just Emmet helped me shorten the time but also reduced human errors since it will provide automatic close tag and shortcut. 
For the next WODs, I will read the instructions multiple times and more carefully. The assignment instructions usually tell you exactly what needs to be done with orders. I will start WODs after understanding these instructions. 

For Browser Hisotry1, I found it easy to follow the intructions and I was able to finish it with my second attempt without the screencast to help me out. It was a good review of how to make a list with ul and li tags on html, and how to create hypertest with a link so that the user can click the word to know the definition. 

For Browser History 2, we were asked to add cascading style sheet to the simple html file with link tag and also apply oswald font. I found this relatively easy and I was able to finish the assignment in approximantely 10 minutes. 

For browser Hisotry 3, we were asked to add more styles on Browser Hisotry 2. I applied paragraph formats and apply horizontal view on the table to contents. The instruction was very simple and I got confused with "float" in the style sheets, but I was able to fix the issues with my second attempt without the screencast.
