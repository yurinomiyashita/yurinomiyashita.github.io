##How was my experience?
For my first attempt, I struggled to start off because I had no idea what to start with. Watching the screencast for the first time gave me some ideas however, it was still confusing and the result was DFN with more than 10 minutes over.  Then, I watched Youtube videos about Emmet to  learn about Emmet abbreviations. Not just Emmet helped me shorten the time but also reduced human errors since it will provide automatic close tag and shortcut. 

##What I am doing next timeNext time?
I will read the instructions multiple times and more carefully. The assignment instructions usually tell you exactly what needs to be done with orders. I will start WODs after understanding these instructions.
