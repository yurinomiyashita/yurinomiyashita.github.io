Why I decided to major in MIS
When I started my college career, I had no idea what I wanted to study in the university. Through out my freshman year, I took multiple introductory classes on several different subjects anincluding ICS 101, which took me into basic understanding of computers, and since than I’m interested in Information Technology. That’s why I decided to major in MIS.
